Gin is a high performance Web framework written in Go that is 40 times faster than Martini
1) It is very fast, since it utilises radix tree based routing with a small memory footprint
2) Middleware support 
3) Cache free
4) Json validation
5) Route Grouping
6) Error management

* The Router is an important concept in Gin that is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests 
and routing them to the appropriate handlers
* There are two methods 
router :=gin.Default() --> provides logging and recovery middleware 
router :=gin.New() --> Without default middleware

* Gin supports the following HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS

* Context (gin.Context) is responsible for carrying request data, validating JSON and rendering responses
